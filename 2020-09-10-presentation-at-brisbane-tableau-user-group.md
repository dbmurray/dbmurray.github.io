I presented at September 2020 Brisbane Tableau User Group alongside Mark Jeffrey from Griffith University and Ronak Mathur, the President of QUT Business Analysis and Data Science Club.

I presented some of the background to the visualisation [I presented at the Virtual Refugee Conference in June 2020](https://darraghmurray.com/data/refuge-from-the-storm-internally-displaced-peoples-in-the-age-of-the-climate-crisis/).

Thanks to Frederic Fery and Key Data for inviting me to speak.
