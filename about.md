My name is Darragh Murray, a strategic data analyst and data visualiser who primarily works in the education sector within Australia. Thanks for stopping by my corner of the web.

On this website, you’ll find some of my writing data visualisation and analytics. You’ll also find links to my growing portfolio of data visualisation work along with a list of public presentations, publications and consulting work.

I generally concentrate on subjects such as:

<ul>
<li>Strategic data analytics and market intelligence in education, particularly international education.</li>
<li>Issues in international politics and economics that overlap with international education.</li>
<li>Data storytelling as a useful method of exchanging knowledge – mainly using open data.</li>
<li>Older posts relate to my past life as a database developer.</li>
<li>I regularly talk and write about the nexus of education and data and frequently present throughout the world on these topics. I’ve listed my conference appearances below.</li>
</ul>

I’ve worked in several fields before transitioning into international education such as commercial dispute resolution, housing, as well as the public service. I’ve also been involved in the music industry, being a freelance music journalist as well as a radio producer for local community radio.

You may also note that this website is also the home of the UN Internship F.A.Q. which is now quite out of date considering I interned at the United Nations over a decade ago.

It’s merely a guide to help prospective interns on what they might expect should they be lucky enough to intern at UN headquarters in New York. Or at least what it was like back in 2010. 

I have formal tertiary qualifications in information systems, international relations, history and business analytics. I currently work for a leading global education provider and am based in Brisbane, Australia.

Feel free to get in contact if you have any queries related to my professional work or feel like saying g’day.

Cheers!

Darragh
