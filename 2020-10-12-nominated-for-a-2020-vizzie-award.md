I choose a poor week to go on holidays and my time off coincided with the annual [Tableau conference](https://www.tableau.com/community/events/conference) which this year was held virtually. I didn&#8217;t bring any technology with me during my holiday and thus found it difficult to tune in to what looked like a great series of talks and presentations. 

On my way home, I logged into Twitter to see that a local Tableau legend from my home town in Brisbane ([Frederic Fery](https://datavisual.blog/)) had tagged me in a picture that showed that I&#8217;d unexpectedly been nominated for a Vizzie award in the category of &#8220;Data Do-Gooder&#8221; (Frederic also, quite deservedly, was nominated in the same category!)

This was quite an unexpected honour and I&#8217;d like to thank those who put my name down in this category! Big congratulations to the deserved winner though, **[Brian Moore](https://public.tableau.com/profile/brian.moore7221#!/)**, who started the #TheSDGVizProject initiative earlier this year. [You can read an interview with Brian here where he talks all about this project](https://datavizblog.com/2020/04/09/tableau-community-spotlight-an-interview-with-brian-moore/).
