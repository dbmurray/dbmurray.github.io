I've updated my webpage to use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) & [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) using a customised version of the [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) theme.

For the past 15 or so years, I've been using the database-driven [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) system, but I've been quite frustrated with it for some time. At some point Wordpress, theme-designers in particular, pivoted away from it being a simple tool used to write and publish to a tool seemingly targetted at graphic designers and portfolios. Newer Wordpress themes have always frustrated me.

I  wanted something that would serve text and images and not much more. Github Pages serves this purpose, doesn't use a database nor any fancy bloated plugins and also is free. That's all I need. 

So, welcome to the new iteration of my webpage. This should become [darraghmurray.com](https://darraghmurray.com) at some point soon.
