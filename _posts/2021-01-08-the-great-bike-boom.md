Not going to go into a great deal of detail on this one. It's a relatively straightforward visualisation of the dataset made available for the first <a href="https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/">#MakeOverMonday</a> project of 2021.

We were asked to visualise rail trail usuage data in the United States during 2020 and this is what I came up with.

This was more about experimentation than anything else. I spent quite a lot of time getting the curvy/sigmoid area charts to work properly (thanks to <a href="https://tableaumagic.com/sigmoid-area-charts-in-tableau/">Tableau Magic</a> for the useful instructions). 

I little to no time on anything else (such as the headers and descriptions), so I think it looks a bit naff, but c'est la vie. MakeOverMonday is suppose to be something done quickly anyway, so I'm still keeping it out there. I learned something, so thats a win.

In the meantime, you can view the completed visualisation here by clicking the link below:
