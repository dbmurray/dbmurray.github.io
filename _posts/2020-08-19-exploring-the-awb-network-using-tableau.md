I was a late submission to the latest #VizForSocialGood round but I did manage to finish off a visualisation that made extensive use of an interactive network diagram.

I&#8217;ll be writing much more about how I did this in the near future and will update this post. Want to give a quick shout out to this very helpful tutorial by [Christopher Conn of The Data Surfers](https://thedatasurfers.com/2019/08/27/how-to-use-gephi-to-create-network-visualizations-for-tableau/) which this visualisation shares heritage with.
