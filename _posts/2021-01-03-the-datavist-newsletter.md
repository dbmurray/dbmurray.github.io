title: The Datavist | A newsletter on data visualisation, story telling and the humanities
excerpt_separator:  <!--more-->

I love curated email newsletters. I subscribe to many and they definitely increase my enjoyment of the web. While social media does have quite a bit of great content on it, it's noisy and the good stuff can be hard to find. Newsletters allow me to source better content through trusted voices. All signal, little noise. 

For quite some time, I've been thinking about starting my own newsletter, but I had struggled to think of an idea I might be passionate enough about to write consistently about. That is until I started doing a few volunteer projects with <a href="https://www.vizforsocialgood.com/">Viz For Social Good</a>, an endeavour that seeks to <i>"harness the power of data visualisation for social change"</i>. 

I did a few of my own visualisations, including this one examining the <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/darragh.murray#!/vizhome/SeekingRefugeFromtheStorm/RefugeFromtheStorm">impact of climate change on forced migration</a>, and it got me thinking: "this area is really exciting - I would love to write about this."

And finally, it's come to pass. I've just published <a href="https://thedatavist.substack.com/p/female-activism-in-the-time-of-covid19">the first edition of my new newsletter The Datavist via Substack</a>. In this edition, I'm simply sharing a few links to great stories which combined data visualisation with topics relevant to the humanities. 

I won't go into further details as I've put the rationale all in the first edition, but <a href="https://thedatavist.substack.com/">I'd encourage you to subscribe if this subject matter interests you</a>.
